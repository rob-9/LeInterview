An AI-powered mock interview platform that provides real-time feedback on technical and behavioral interviews.

## Features

- Real-time Speech Recognition: Records and transcribes your responses during interviews
- AI Feedback: Provides instant feedback on your interview performance using Google's Gemini AI
- Code Execution: Execute and test code in Python, Java, C++, and JavaScript directly in the browser
- Company-specific Questions: Get interview questions tailored to specific companies
- Responsive UI: Modern, responsive interface optimized for all devices
- Secure: No hardcoded API keys, proper environment variable management

## Quick Start

### Automated Setup

1. Clone the repository:
```bash
git clone <repository-url>
cd LeInterview
```

2. Run the setup script:
```bash
python setup.py
```

3. Edit `.env` file and add your GEMINI_API_KEY
